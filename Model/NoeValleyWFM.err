   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* InterZone Surface Areas -- mismatch
   ************* ..Area mismatch errors happen when the interzone surface in zone A is
   ************* ..not the same size as it's companion in zone B.
   ************* Temperature (low) out of bounds
   ************* ..A temperature out of bounds problem can be caused by several things. The user should check:
   ************* ..1) the weather environment (including the horizontal IR from sky)
   ************* ..2) the level of interal gains with respect to the zone
   ************* ..3) the thermal properties of their materials.  And other things.
   ************* ..A common cause is a building with no or little thermal mass - all materials with Material:NoMass definitions.
   ************* Temperature (high) out of bounds
   ************* ..A temperature out of bounds problem can be caused by several things. The user should check:
   ************* ..1) the weather environment (including the horizontal IR from sky)

   ************* ..A common cause is a building with no or little thermal mass - all materials with Material:NoMass definitions.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
